**Exercice PHP - Class CSS**

**Aim**

The aim of this project is to estimate your coding skills. This exercise is built to be too long for you to finish it, therefore your **aim is not to finish it**. We are trying to estimate your coding skills but also **your ability to split a project into tasks** and **prioritise** them. We’re **interested in your qualities** and not your flaws; so we advise to start with what you think you’d do best. **We value way more an unfinished project with good code in it to a big project fulled of quick and dirty.** If you manage to finish the exercise you’re definitely allowed to offer or implement extension ideas. The requirements are wide on purpose and you’ll have to select **the best option** to answer this exercise.

**Presentation**

The purpose of the exercise is to determine all unnecessary CSS attributes. Let **S** be a website with all its CSS in separate CSS files (it is assumed that there is no CSS added by JS or in HTML). You have to find all the useless attributes, that is to say all those being in selectors not used by the HTML and all those being systematically overridden by more precise selectors. We advise you to start by determining all the useless selectors. The input must be an url and you can set the output format.

**Specifications**

- You must code a program in JS (NodeJS) or PHP.
- The code will have to be hosted in the Github repo made available. The code must be coded using Git and the cleanliness of the tree will be studied.
- You will have one week to complete the exercise from the reception of this file, we advise you to spend at least 5 hours on it. At the next interview, 30 minutes (15 minutes presentation and 15 minutes questions) will be devoted to the presentation of the code. The presentation time being extremely short, choose the passages you want to present.
- You are free to use any dependencies and external services that you wish but Stockly should not have to pay to test your code.
- You can use the frameworks or modules of your choice. However we only study your code, if everything is done by the modules we will be unable to evaluate you. As a great man said: "Great power implies great responsibilities! "

**Criteria in order of importance**

- Structure of the code.
- Clean code.
- Number of features implemented.
- Qualities of the imagined solutions.
- Tree git: commit messages and tree structure
